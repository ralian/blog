# .gitconfig generator

I neglected to put anything about this on my blog when I created it, last November. It was an idea borne of a struggle and annoyance - always having to set the same options when I set up a new laptop, on repeat.

And yes, I could have just committed a common .gitconfig file for myself somewhere handy, like a rational person. But instead, I decided to make a [tool](https://ralian.github.io/gitconfig-generator/) for it.

(The real rationale is because I wanted a tool that shows you all available options for your config alongside a way to turn them on/off, rather than having to read the markdown docs while editing a text file. Also, I wanted a way to pick terminal colors without having to look up the 256 terminal code mappings each time. If you scroll to the bottom of the page, you'll find a handy color picker that Claude Code generated... I don't do frontend code, and I've come to love generative AI for solving exactly that sort of problem: one where a children's hospital won't explode if it gives you an invalid color code for your config.)

If you load the suggested settings, you'll get the absolute beauty of a color scheme I created:

I call it Grue.

Happy new year!
